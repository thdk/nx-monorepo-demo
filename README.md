# Nx Monorepo Demo

[![CI](https://github.com/thdk/nx-monorepo-demo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thdk/nx-monorepo-demo/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Welcome to my Nx Monorepo Demo! This repository showcases how Nx can be leveraged to manage a monorepo effectively, combining libraries, applications, and infrastructure projects. The goal is to demonstrate the versatility and power of Nx in handling diverse setups.

## Features

- **Centralized Management**: Manage multiple projects, including applications, libraries, and infrastructure, within a single repository.
- **Custom Nx Plugin**: Includes a custom Nx plugin for Terraform projects, enabling seamless integration and management of infrastructure-as-code.
- **Optimized Build System**: Utilize Nx's caching and dependency graph to optimize builds and CI/CD workflows.
- **Diverse Project Types**: Support for Node.js, React, and Terraform projects, showcasing Nx's flexibility.

### Other Projects

#### scripts

Utility scripts for managing projects in this repository.

- `release.ts`: Automates release processes.
- `docker-build.ts`: Handles Docker image builds.

#### tools/nx-terraform

Custom Nx package to manage Terraform targets for projects containing Terraform files.

- **Documentation**: [nx-terraform README](./tools/nx-terraform/README.md)

#### releases/thdk

A project dedicated to maintaining a unified version number across multiple independently versioned and deployed applications.

## Development

### Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running Targets

```sh
# Run all relevant targets (build, lint, test, ...) for every project
npx nx run-all

# Run all relevant targets (build, lint, test, ...) for affected projects only
npx nx run-affected
```

### Syncpack

This is an external tool not related with nx but works very well together with nx repos.

Why syncpack?

- ensures all packages use the same version for dependencies
- ensures app dependencies use the same range specifier

Provided commands in the repo:

```sh
npx nx syncpack
npx nx syncpack-fix
```

However these are automatically run for you in CI and will block any thing that doesn't follow the rules.

### IaC with terraform and Nx

A custom terraform plugin will infer terraform targets for each project with a `main.tf` file.

Terraform state for this repo is kept in a GCP bucket for which you must be authenticated if you would want to run this locally (CI authorizes with GCP using Workload Identity Federation)

```sh
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login

# if using docker
gcloud auth configure-docker
# if using podman (aliased as docker)
gcloud auth print-access-token | docker login -u oauth2accesstoken --password-stdin https://europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev
```

```sh
# init target is a dependency of other terraform targets so usually you do not have to run it explicitly
npx nx run-many --target terraform-init

npx nx run-many --target terraform-plan

# currently will use --auto-approve so use with caution after inspecting output of terraform-plan command
# TODO: Make this target interactive so user can manually confirm the action for each project.
npx nx run-many --target terraform-apply

```
